## Why ?!
So, while working on some projects, I kept running into designs that needed the rights request functions to be in different visual components. Instead of copying and pasting the same code everywhere, I decided to streamline things by pulling that functionality into its own package.

This project is a SwiftUI example demonstrating how to handle camera permission and scanning functionality in an iOS application. The project utilizes the `grand_access` library to manage permissions.

This example is created to demonstrate the usage of the [grand_access](https://github.com/The-Igor/grand-access) library.

##Features

- [x] Request camera permission using the [grand_access](https://github.com/The-Igor/grand-access) library.
- [x] Display an alert if the camera permission is not granted.
- [x] Present a full-screen scanner view when permission is granted.
- [x] Customize the button appearance with various properties like system image, font type, weight, width, and tint color.
